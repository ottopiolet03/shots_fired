# TO INSTALL ON YOUR COMPUTER
I recommend downloading VS Code, it is free.

Otherwise -

Go to folder where you want to store the project (it can be anywhere):
For example, mine is C:\Users\ottom\Documents\shotsFired

Double click the search bar, so that your folder path is highlighted. Replace text with cmd and hit enter.
This should open a Command Terminal in the folder 
(on VS Code, opening a terminal while you are in the correct folder will do this for you)

**Side Note**: do not do this in a folder that is on the cloud or somewhere that syncs with something else

run the commands:

git clone https://github.com/ottopiolet03/shots_fired.git

cd shots_fired

npm i


Wait for each to finish before the the next
